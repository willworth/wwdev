    <p>Most recently, I've been focusing on Javascript- with Node, Express, and React.
      My desire to improve these skills led me to choose Gatsby to build
      this site (though, frankly, I don't feel I'm fully leveraging the advantages of React, yet). </p>
      <p>For details of what I've been working on, please see my  <Link to="/portfolio">portfolio</Link>. </p>
      <p>Apart from the above, I've also worked with wordpress and PHP, and as a tester with a
       python stack on a large scale webscraping project. </p>

    <p> If you have something I may be able to help with
       (I'm open to opensource volunteer project work, too), please do get in touch.</p>
