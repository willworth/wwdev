Hi!

####  This is my personal coding site.  You are free to :recycle: copy things, and even ask me for help if you get stuck!   :ok_hand:  #### 

## I have learnt a lot from clear, beginner-friendly readme files, so I aim to provide the same here. ##

This site(blog) is a fork of one of the official [Gatsby](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/) [starters](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-starters/).  Gatsby is a static site generator for [React](https://reactjs.org/).   React is a library for controlling and updating the *display* of a website, so you can use it with any [backend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends).  Gatsby is a way to put together parts of simple websites so that they load quickly. So Gatsby is a good choice if you want to make a simple site while learning modern technologies! :thumbsup:



I am hosting my site on [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) as lots of companies use AWS for big projects and it's a useful tool to be able to use, but there are simpler options- notably Netlify, surge.sh and even github pages.  If you are just getting started, I recommend [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).


Steps:

1)Copy the code to your computer  (clone the github repo).
[Here](https://services.github.com/on-demand/resources/) are some git learning resources, in case you need them.


2)Open the folder/directory in your command prompt/terminal.
You know you are in the right place if you can see the package.json file.  This is the recipe list for everything.


## Prerequisites! Requirements! ##
Make sure you have a recent version of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

Then run each of the following (in your command prompt/terminal, in the folder with the package.json file.):

```bash

npm install --global gatsby-cli

npm i

gatsby develop


```

And if that all worked you should be running a local version of the site for you to work with!  You'll know it's worked if the command prompt shows you a link to click on like "localhost".  If you get an error, try not to worry.  Something may be out of date.  This happens all the time and is something you need to get used to if you want to be a coder.  Look at the error, google it, etc.


If you need any help or have suggestions as to how to make these instructions clearer, please get in touch.

Will     :wave:
