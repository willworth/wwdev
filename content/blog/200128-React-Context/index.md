I made a little demo app to explain how to use [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) (that's a link to the official docs page).

Rather than a blog post, this is best seen through the app itself. Find it [here on github](https://github.com/willworth/contextexampleapp), or [here on codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/willworth/contextexampleapp).
