I'm at the point now- with a CRUD app and a separate React front end project pulling from an API- that I think I can start applying for jobs.  I'm obviously going to keep coding every day and working on improving my skills, but I think it's time to start.  The trouble with these things is that you can always convince yourself that there's more to learn- there always will be.  Despite that, I'm confident that I can usefully help a code team, and I'm excited to be out there, with a real world project, rather than the abstract persuit of ability.
